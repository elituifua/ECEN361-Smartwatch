# Smart Watch
### Brigham Young University Idaho (ECEN-361)


### Welcome!
Welcome to the repository for the code used in our ECEN-361 Final Project. The code in this repository was used to create a "smart watch" device capable of telling the time (of course), date, and weather. In addition, the device implemented an accelerometer for keeping track of the user's steps as well as a pulse reader to display the user's heart rate.

This project was an excellent chance for us to implement our knowledge of the interactions between hardware and software. We had a wonderful time creating this device and enjoyed being able to create something that showcased our talents.
